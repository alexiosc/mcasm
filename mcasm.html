<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>mcasm</B> is a Microcode assembler.
<P>

It accepts as input a file describing microcode and produces one or
more ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, Flash etc images suitable for inclusion in a
software emulator or a hardware device.
<P>

Before moving to the options, it will be necessary to offer a gentler
introduction into microcode and microcode ROMs, and explain a number
of definitions used throughout this document.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MICROCODE</H2>

According to the Wikipedia entry, Microcode is a layer of
hardware-level instructions and/or data structures involved in the
implementation of higher level machine code instructions in many
computers and other processors; it resides in a special high-speed
memory and translates machine instructions into sequences of detailed
circuit-level operations. It helps separate the machine instructions
from the underlying electronics so that instructions can be designed
and altered more freely. It also makes it feasible to build complex
multi-step instructions while still reducing the complexity of the
electronic circuitry compared to other methods. Writing microcode is
often called microprogramming and the microcode in a particular
processor implementation is sometimes called a microprogram.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MOTIVATION</H2>

Writing microcode for a large, existing architecture is an art form,
and one with its own tools. However, hobbyists also find themselves in
need of writing microcode for homebrew CPUs or other microcodable
devices. In that case, having a small, generic tool would speed up
development, and reduce the chance of bugs making their way to
hardware, where they could conveivable even damage lovingly assembled
electronics.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SOME TERMS</H2>

Microcode is a two-dimensional structure. It helps to see it as a
table where rows are microprogram addresses, and columns are
microprogram instructions.
<P>

A <B>micro-instruction</B> is a long bitstring separated into a number
of <B>fields</B>, each one or more bits wide. Each field controls one
of the units of the microprocessor in some way, or sends out various
<B>signals</B>. Each field may have one value and one value only.
<P>

Single-bit signals may be either <B>0</B> or <B>1</B>. Multiple-bit
signals may be any binary number.
<P>

Microcode <B>addresses</B> are actually composite structures, formed
from a number of different sources. There is a conventional
`microprogram counterâ€™ which holds the microinstruction currently
executed, but a number of other pieces of information also make up the
final address of the microinstruction, e.g. the instruction register,
the reset signal, flag registers, et cetera.
<P>

We call these pieces of information <B>conditions</B>. A
<B>condition</B> is part of the address of a micro-instruction.
<P>

A single-bit condition may be <B>0</B>, <B>1</B> or <B>X</B> (don't-care)
if we it's not implicated in a particular micro-program. Multiple-bit
conditions may involve any permuation of these three values.
<P>

In mathematical terms, microcode is a multivariate function mapping
condition field values to signals. In computer science terms,
microcode is a way of specifying a Finite State Machine with a
potentially huge number of states.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<B>mcasm</B> accepts the following options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-c</B>, <B>--c</B>

<DD>
Outputs the ROM images as C code in the form of a header file. The
header file contains bitfield structures for the ROM's address and
data fields, macros for creating ROM addresses, macros for checking
parts of the data (output), and an array with the ROM data itself,
which may be conditionally compiled into a C source file as needed.
<B>-d</B>, <B>--debug</B>

Prints out a human-readable form of the assembled ROM. This is mostly
meant for debugging of the assembler itself, but may also be used to
debug the microcode.
<DT><B>-e</B>, <B>--verilog</B>

<DD>
Outputs one or more `binary' files for Verilog use. Each file
corresponds to an 8-bit-wide ROM and may be read with the
<B>$readmemb</B>


containing ASCII representations of binary numbers:
</DL>
<P>

<TT>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
</TT><PRE>
00001011 // addr=0000
00001011 // addr=0001
00011001 // addr=0002
00000000 // addr=0003
00000000 // addr=0004
00000000 // addr=0005
00000000 // addr=0006
00000000 // addr=0007
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>


<B>-h</B>, <B>--help</B>

List all available options and their meanings.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-m</B>, <B>--mappings</B>

<DD>
Prints out the symbol to bit mappings for conditions and signals. This
can prove useful in generating hardware descriptions, as well as debugging.
<DT><B>-p</B>, <B>--preprocess</B>

<DD>
Preprocess output and exit immediately. The default preprocessor is
the C compiler's C Preprocessor. This may be overridden by setting the
<B>CPP</B> environment variable to a suitable preprocessor.
<DT><B>-s</B>, <B>--stats</B>

<DD>
Output statistics on the microcode. The statistics include the
recommended number and size of the microcode ROMs as well as
statistics on the biggest microprogram, and optimisation suggestions.
<DT><B>-V</B>, <B>--vhdl</B>

<DD>
Output a VHDL fragment containing the information in the microcode
table. The fragment is sent to standard output.
<DT><B>-v</B>, <B>--verbose</B>

<DD>
Be verbose. Prints out each parsed microprogram. If <B>--C</B> or
<B>--color</B> is specified and the standard output is capable of it,
the output will be colour-coded for readability.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>MICROCODE SYNTAX</H2>

<P>

First things first: <B>mcasm</B> uses the C preprocessor (or any other
preprocessor specified in the <B>CPP</B> environment variable) to allow
for macros and, in the future, conditional compilation. If you are not
comfortable with the C Preprocessor, please start by reading how it
works and how it transforms text.
<P>

Having said that, this is a very brief example of a microcode input
file:
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<TT>
</TT><PRE>
// Minimum Microcode file.

cond OP:4;
cond uaddr:3;

signal /MEMIO    = ....1;
signal MREAD     = ...1.;
signal MWRITE    = ..1..;

field  REGMOVE   = XX___;
signal MAR &lt;- PC = 01...;
signal IR &lt;- MEM = 10...;

start OP=XXXX; // A tiny fetch instruction
  /MEMIO, MREAD, MAR &lt;- PC;   // 
  hold;                       // Same as MEMIO, MREAD, MAR &lt;- PC
  hold, -MREAD, IR &lt;- MEM;    // Same as MEMIO, MAR &lt;- PC, IR &lt;- MEM

// End of file.
</PRE>


</DL>

<P>

C multi-line comments <B>/* ... */</B> and C++ single-line 
comments <B>// ...</B> are both understood.
<P>

All declarations must end in a semicolon.
<P>

This defines two fields in the ROM's address: the <B>OP</B> field, four
bits wide, and the <B>uaddr</B> field, which is three bits wide. The
last <B>cond</B> defined is the least significant part of the address.
<P>

The condition <B>uaddr</B> is the microprogram counter and is
mandatory.
<P>

The <B>signal</B> declarations define the output of the ROM. The
bitfield for each signal is specified in binary. You may use the
traditional values 0 and 1. For increased readability, you may also
use the characters `.' or `-' for zero.
<P>

Conditionals are made up of letters, numbers, and non-whitespace characters
except colons (<B>:</B>), semicolons (<B>;</B>) and equal signs (<B>=</B>).
<P>

Signal names may contain any character except the equals sign
(=). Notably, they may include spaces (for legibility). A signal may
not start with a minus sign (<B>-</B>).
<P>

Signals starting with a slash (<B>/</B>) are recognised as active-low
signals. Their bitstrings are inverted when the ROM is output.
<P>

Fields may be named for convenience. Macros to extract field values
will be added to any C output generated. Field definitions may use
<B>X</B>, <B>x</B> or <B>+</B> to specify a bit that's included in the
field, and <B>.</B>, <B>_</B>, or <B>-</B> to specify bits that are
excluded from the field.
<P>

Microprograms are declared with the <B>start</B> keyword, followed by a
comma-separated set of conditionals and their values in the format
<I>cond</I>=<I>value</I>. If a particular field is immaterial to a
microprogram, a don't care value may be specified using the standard
electronics don't care symbol, <B>X</B>.
<P>

After the <B>start</B> keyword, the microprogram may be specified. Each
line of the microprogram defines a comma separated list of zero or
more signal names as defined previously. The order of signals in each
line does not matter. Lines are terminated with semicolons (so that,
in practice, each may span multiple actual lines in the source code).
<P>

A special keyword used in some cases is <B>hold</B>. When encountered,
it indicates that the set of signals active on the previous line
should be active on the line where <B>hold</B> appears. In this case,
some signals may be deactivated by listing them prefixed with a
minus. For example, the <B>-MREAD</B> specification on line 3 of the
microprogram above turns off the <B>MREAD</B> signal.
<P>

Multiple microprograms may be specified with multiple <B>start</B>
keywords. When using don't-care values, start with the least specific
(most <B>X</B> bits) microprograms and move on to the most specific ones.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>HISTORY</H2>

<P>

This program originated as the microcode compiler for the CFT CPU.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

<P>

There are probably quite a few here and there, although thankfully not
in the code generation. Using the C Preprocessor makes the program
fairly kludgy.
<P>

Error reporting could be somewhat better.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RESTRICTIONS</H2>

<B>mcasm</B> can generate microcode for architectures where microcode
jumps around a lot, but its syntax is more suited to architectures
where microcode is executed mostly sequentially with occasional
jumps. If your architecture doesn't even have the notion of a
microprogram, <B>mcasm</B> may not suit you.
